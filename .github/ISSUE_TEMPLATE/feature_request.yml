        💼 [CosmoCode](https://www.cosmocode.de) is a software company in Berlin providing services for wiki,
        app and web development. We're happy to release some of our work as Open Source, but please be aware
        that we are not able to provide free support.


        🛑 Most of our project development is highly driven by our customers' needs. As such the implementation
        of community submitted feature requests is rare.


        🤝 If you require certain features or functionality, you can always hire us.
        Feel free to contact us at info@cosmocode.de for a custom offer.
